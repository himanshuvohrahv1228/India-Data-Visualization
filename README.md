🇮🇳 India Data Visualization Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with Streamlit, Plotly Express, Pandas, and NumPy that visualizes India’s district-level socio-economic data in a beautiful and meaningful way.

📊 Overview

This project transforms raw district-level data into an interactive visualization tool where users can:

✅ Explore data for all of India or filter by specific states
✅ Compare districts based on custom-selected parameters
✅ View relationships between metrics like literacy, population, internet access, and workforce
✅ Enjoy a dynamic, interactive map built using Plotly Express

🧠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

NumPy — for numerical operations

Pandas — for data handling and analysis

Plotly Express — for beautiful, interactive graphs

Streamlit — for the web dashboard

🖼️ Features

🧭 How It Works

The dashboard reads data from India.csv

Sidebar controls let users select a state, primary, and secondary parameter

A scatter map is generated where:

Marker size → represents the primary parameter

Marker color → represents the secondary parameter
